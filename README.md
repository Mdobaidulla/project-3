# Introduction

For project 3 of the SEI experience provided by General Assembly, the goal is to build a fully functioning web application using ReactJS and an API of our choosing. The app must contain the following components:

1. A front-end React application that updates the UI and makes requests to the API.
2. Includes data from a third-party API.
